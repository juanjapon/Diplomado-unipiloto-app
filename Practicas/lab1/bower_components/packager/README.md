Packager
========

Packager is an AMD plugin that adds some features for package development.

Features:

1. Relative path mappings

   Ever wanted to define path mappings relative to the current module? Well now you can.

2. Factory filtering

   Ever wanted an easy way to define a function to process module factories? Not a problem.

3. ID filtering

   Ever wanted to implement a custom AMD ID format? You can do that too.

What? No tests?!
----------------

I know, sorry about that. This project is (almost all) ripped out of my [Modular AMD project](https://github.com/asmblah/modular) in an attempt to play nicely with RequireJS. The tests will be ported across soon, I promise.
